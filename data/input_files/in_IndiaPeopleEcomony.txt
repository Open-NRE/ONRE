Road Transport India has one of the largest road networks in the world with a total length of 42.3 lakh km (2008-09).
Traffic on the 300-km Srinagar-Jammu and 434- km Srinagar-Leh National Highways is suspended as upper reaches of J&K saw heavy snowfall while rain lashed the plains.
A view of traffic flow in Delhi Fig. 10.1 70 per cent of freight traffic are carried by roads every year.
It is bifurcated into 2 segments : (a) National Highway(NH)-1 from Delhi to Amritsar, and (b) NH- 2 from Delhi to Kolkata.
The length of the National Highways has increased from 19,700 km in 1951 to 70,934 km in 2008-09.
The National Highways constitute only 1.67 per cent of the total road length but carry 40 per cent of the road traffic.

North-South and East-West Corridors : North-South corridor aims at connecting Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir with Kaniyakumari in Tamil Nadu (including Kochchi-Salem Spur) with 4,076 km long road.
The East-West Corridor has been planned to connect Silchar in Assam with the port town of Porbandar in Gujarat with 3,640 km of road length.
These constitute 4 per cent of total road length in the country.
They account for 14 per cent of the total road length of the country.

On the other hand, share of population is very small in the states like Jammu & Kashmir (1.04%), Arunachal Pradesh (0.11%) and Uttarakhand (0.84%) inspite of theses states having fairly large geographical area.
The density of population in India (2011) is 382 persons per sq km.
There has been a steady increase of more than 200 persons per sq km over the last 50 years as the density of population increased from 117 persons/ sq km in 1951 to 382 persons/sq km in 2011.
The data shown in Appendix (i)A give an idea of spatial variation of population densities in the country which ranges from as low as 17 persons per sq km in Arunachal Pradesh to 11,320 persons in the National Capital Territory of Delhi.

As per 2001 census, out of 1,029 million people in the country, 307 million (30 per cent) were reported as migrants by place of birth.
However, this figure was 315 million (31 per cent) in case of place of last residence.
o n 16 India : People and EconomyA few facts pertaining to the internal migration (within the country) and international migration (out of the country and into the country from other countries) are presented here.
Under the internal The distribution of male and female migrants in different streams of intra-state and inter-state migration is presented in Fig. 2.1 a and 2.1 b.
Table 2.1 presents the details of migrants from neighbouring countries.
In India, during 2001, out of 315 million migrants, enumerated on the basis of the last residence, 98 million had changed their place of residence in the last ten years.
Out of these, 96 per cent came from the neighbouring countries: Bangladesh (3.0 million) followed by Pakistan (0.9 million) and Nepal (0.5 million).
Included in this are 0.16 million refugees from T ibet, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, and Myanmar.
As far as emigration from India is concerned it is estimated that there are around 20 million people of Indian Diaspora, spread across 110 countries.
Migration: Types, Causes and Consequences 17Represent the data given in Table 2.1 by pie diagrams assuming the migration from neighbouring countries (4,918,266 persons as 100 per cent).
Maharashtra occupied first place in the list with 2.3 million net in-migrants, followed by Delhi, Gujarat and Haryana.

For example, work and employment have remained the main cause for male migration (38 per cent) while it is only three per cent for the females.

Table 3.3 showing the percentage of literates in India reveals some interesting features: • Overall literacy in India is approximately 65. 4 per cent (2001).
while female literacy is 54.16 per cent.
There is a state like Bihar which has very low (47.53 per cent) literacy and there are states like Kerala and Mizoram which have literacy rates of 90.92 and 88.49 per cent respectively.

What is the rank of India among the 172 countries of the world?
As indicated in table 3.4 Kerala with the composite index value of 0.638 is placed at the top rank followed by Punjab (0.537), Tamil Nadu (0.531) Maharashtra (0.523) and Haryana (0.509).
As expected, states like Bihar (0.367), Assam (0.386), Uttar Pradesh (0.388), Madhya Pradesh (0.394) and Orissa (0.404) are at the bottom among the 15 major states in India.
Kerala is able to record the highest value in the HDI largely due to its impressive performance in achieving near hundred per cent literacy (90.92 per cent) in 2001.
For example, total literacy rate for Bihar was as low as 60.32 per cent during the same year.
For Kerala, it is 6.34 per cent, while it is 26.75 per cent in Bihar and 25.95 per cent in Madhya Pradesh.d e h s T i l R b E u C p N re © e b o t t Can you find out the causes of the above problems?

India produces a variety of cereals, which are classified as fine grains (rice, wheat) and coarse grains (jowar, bajra, maize, ragi), etc. Account of important cereals has been given in the following paragraphs : Fig. 5.2 : Rice transplantation in southern parts of India growing areas.

There are three cotton growing areas, i.e. parts of Punjab, Haryana and northern Rajasthan in north-west, Gujarat and Maharashtra in the west and plateaus of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu Fig. 5.8 : Sugarcane Cultivation Land Resources and Agriculture 51 2015-16Fig.

But India produces only about 3.2 per cent coffee of the world and ranks seventh after Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, Ethopia and Mexico in 2008-09.
In spite of this, there is tremendous pressure on agricultural land in India, which is reflected from the fact that the land-human ratio in the country is only 0.31 ha which is almost half of that of the world as a whole (0.59 ha).

Land Resources and Agriculture 59 2015-16 Unit III Chapter 6 WATER RESOURCES Do you think that what exists today will continue to be so, or the future is going to be different in some respects?
Approximately, 71 per cent of the earth’s surface is covered with it but fresh water constitutes only about 3 per cent of the total water.
Water Resources of India India accounts for about 2.45 per cent of world’s surface area, 4 per cent of the world’s water resources and about 16 per cent of world’s population.
The availability from surface water and replenishable groundwater is 1,869 cubic km.
Out of this only 60 per cent can be put to beneficial uses.
Thus, the total utilisable water resource in the country is only 1,122 cubic km.
In the country, there are about 10,360 rivers and their tributaries longer than 1.6 km each.
The mean annual flow in all the river basins in India is estimated to be 1,869 cubic km.
2015-16However, due to topographical, hydrological and other constraints, only about 690 cubic km (32 per cent) of the available surface water can be utilised.
Given that precipitation is relatively high in the catchment areas of the Ganga, the Brahmaputra and the Barak rivers, these rivers, although account for only about one-third of the total area in the country, have 60 per cent of the total surface water resources.
Table 6.1 shows that the Ganga and the Brahamaputra basins, have about 46 per cent of the total replenishable groundwater resources.

As shown in Fig. 6.2 and 6.3, agriculture accounts for most of the surface and ground water utilisation, it accounts for 89 per cent of the surface water and 92 per cent of the groundwater utilisation.
While the share of industrial sector is limited to 2 per cent of the surface water utilisation and 5 per cent of the ground-water, the share of domestic sector is higher (9 per cent) in surface water utilisation as compared to groundwater.
