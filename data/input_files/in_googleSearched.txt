India is the second most populous country in the world, with over 1.277 billion people (2015), more than a sixth of the world's population.
Already containing 17.5% of the world's population, India is projected to be the world's most populous country by 2022, surpassing China, its population reaching 1.6 billion by 2050.[5][6]
Its population growth rate is 1.2%, ranking 94th in the world in 2013.[7]
India has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[9] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates (the Nihali language[10] spoken in parts of Maharashtra and the Burushaski language spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir).
The United States of America (USA), commonly referred to as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a federal republic[19][20] composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major territories and various possessions.[fn

At 3.8 million square miles (9.842 million km2)[18] and with over 320 million people, the country is the world's third or fourth-largest by total area[fn 3] and the third most populous.
The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast.
On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence.

Canada is the world's second-largest producer of hydroelectricity after China,[2] which accounted for 58% of all electric generation in 2007.[3][4]
Canada is the world's sixth-largest producer of electricity generated by nuclear power, producing 97 billion kWh in 2013.[5]
In April 2014, Ontario became the first jurisdiction in North America to fully eliminate coal as a source of electricity generation.[6][7]
In 2007, Canadian per capita power consumption was among the highest in the world, with an average of 16,995 kWh per annum.[9]
Russia has a high-income[24] mixed economy with state ownership in strategic areas of the economy.
Containing over 30 percent of the world's natural resources,[25] which are estimated to be worth $75.7 trillion, Russia is the most resource-rich country in the world.[26]
As of 2012 the oil-and-gas sector accounted for 16% of the GDP, 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports.[27][28]
Top military exports from Russia include combat aircraft, air defence systems, ships and submarines.[29][30]
Between 2000 and 2012 Russia's energy exports fueled a rapid growth in living standards, with real disposable income rising by 160%.[31]
However, these gains have been distributed unevenly, as the 110 wealthiest individuals were found in a report by Credit Suisse to own 35% of all financial assets held by Russian households.[35][36]
Since 2008 Forbes has repeatedly named Moscow the "billionaire capital of the world".[38][39]
The Russian economy risked going into recession from early 2014 - mainly as a result of the falling oil prices, the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine and the subsequent capital flight.[40][41]
However, the 2014 GDP growth remained positive at 0.6%.[42]
In 2015, the Russian economy shrunk by 3.7% and is expected to shrink further in 2016.[43]
In January 2016, the US company Bloomberg rated Russia's economy as the 12th most innovative in the world,[44] up from 14th in January 2015[45] and 18th in January 2014.[46]

However, Pakistan's undocumented economy is estimated to be 36% of its overall economy, which is not taken into consideration when calculating per capita income.[18]
Pakistan is a developing country[19][20][21] and is one of the Next Eleven, the eleven countries that, along with the BRICS, have a potential to become one of the world's large economies in the 21st century.[22]
The economy is semi-industrialized, with centres of growth along the Indus River.[24][25][26]
Growth poles of Pakistan's economy are situated along the Indus River;[25][28] the diversified economies of Karachi and major urban centers in the Punjab, coexisting with lesser developed areas in other parts of the country.[25]

On 30 September 2015, Turkey submitted its Intended National Determined Contribution (INDC), with a greenhouse gas reduction target (including land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF)) of up to 21% below business as usual (BAU) in 2030.
Excluding LULUCF emissions, this target is equivalent to a 389% increase on 1990 levels, or a 110% increase on 2012 levels.
In comparison, under Turkey’s BAU, emissions are expected to increase by 512% of 1990 levels, or 162% on 2012 levels.
Through mitigation plans which target the whole economy, Turkey’s INDC aims to abate up to 255 MtCO2e in 2030 relative to BAU.
Turkey’s commitment is not in line with interpretations of a “fair” approach to reach a 2°C pathway.
To make a fair contribution to holding warming below 2°C, Turkey would need to double - or even triple - its post-2020 target.
According to our analysis, with the current policies it already has in place, we find that Turkey can achieve 28% of its proposed INDC target i.e. these policies are expected to abate 71 MtCO2e excl.
If the planned policies of the INDC related to the energy sector are implemented,[1] Turkey will achieve 73% of its INDC target.
If realised, 39% of the INDC target will be achieved solely by the additional capacity of hydro power installed.[2]
The wind energy target from the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) has been reduced from 20 GW in 2023 to 16 GW in 2030 while the solar energy target only doubled to reach 10 GW in 2030.
These targets do not reflect the potential of a country with a photovoltaic system performance 50% higher than in Germany[3] (IEA, 2014) and a technical wind power potential of 275 GW[4] (European Commission, 2013)
Moreover, it has been reported in the Press (ClimateWire, 2015) that Turkey is planning to quadruple its coal power plants by 2020 to reach 80 GW, when the projection of a business as usual scenario in the INDC was to reach 23 GW in 2020 and 38 GW in 2030 (CAT estimation).
If it does this, Turkey would emit an estimated additional 340 MtCO2e in 2020 and 250 MtCO2e in 2030 relative to BAU.[5]
The report listed the 58 highest emitters worldwide, which together produce nearly 90 percent of all greenhouse gases, and ranks them according to the steps they are taking to tackle climate change.
No coal plants were opened in 2012 and there were more renewable energy plants integrated to the electricity system,” said Önder Algedik, from the Turkish branch of the “350 Group” founded by environmental activist and author Bill McKibben.
With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842,[3] it is the smallest internationally recognized independent state in the world by both area and population.
It is an ecclesiastical[3] or sacerdotal-monarchical[7] state ruled by the Bishop of Rome – the Pope.
Vatican City is distinct from the Holy See (Latin: Sancta Sedes),[g] which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.2 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe.
The independent city-state, on the other hand, came into existence in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation,[8] not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of central Italy.
Many sources hold that the word is derived from dzimba-dza-mabwe, translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as "large houses of stone" (dzimba = plural of imba, "house"; mabwe = plural of bwe, "stone").[17][18][19]
The first recorded use of "Zimbabwe" as a term of national reference was in 1960, when it was coined by the black nationalist Michael Mawema,[21] whose Zimbabwe National Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961.[22]
It was initially not clear how the chosen term was to be used—a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers to "Zimbabweland"[22]—but "Zimbabwe" was sufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the black nationalist movement.[21]
Over 61 million people live in Italy (61,261,254) as of 2012.
There is only a 34 kilometre (21 mile) gap between England and France and the countries are connected by the Channel Tunnel which opened in 1994.
Located in England and Wales, it stretches around 354 kilometres (220 miles) in length.
The longest river found entirely in England is the River Thames, it flows through London and is slightly shorter than the River Severn at around 346 kilometres (215 miles) in length.
The highest mountain in England is Scafell Pike, which stands at around 978 metres (3,209 ft) in height.
The Summer Olympic Games have been held in London 3 times, in 1908, 1948 and 2012.
