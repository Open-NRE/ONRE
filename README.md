This codebase is unclean and might not work directly. However, BONIE is integrated in Open IE 5.0. Run Open IE 5.0(https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone) to generate extractions from numerical sentences. Our test data and extractions can be found [here](https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone/tree/master/data).

Examples:

    (India ; has population of ; 1.2 billion)

    Microsoft has 10,000 employees.
    (Microsoft ; has ; 10000 employees)
    (Microsoft ; has [number of] employees ; 10000)
